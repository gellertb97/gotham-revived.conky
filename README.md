# Gotham-Revived

<p>This project is based on the original gotham conky widget that is out of development. I've added some things (and I intend to keep doing so until I'm satisfied...), some of them my own work, some of them I've referenced from other conky widgets. Ultimately, I just want an all-in-one widget that just works.</p>

<p>Part of the reason that I started this project is that I love gnome classic and arch linux... and the two combined make running conky widgets very interesting; especially when dealing with transparency. This is the reason you will notice that I have an 'opaque' transparency set at 78%; that's what I found worked best with my wallpaper, but I do encourage everyone to play around with it and make it your own.</p>

<p>I'd like to credit deviantdark from https://www.deviantart.com for his GNU/Linux stickers (CC licensed), which I wrote a script for, and included in the bundle as a personal touch.
